## Installing Ubuntu

For the purpose of this Media Server I chose to run Lubuntu which is a fast and lightweight operating system with a clean and easy-to-use user interface. It is a Linux system, that uses the minimal desktop LXDE/LXQT, and a selection of light applications. Because of this, Lubuntu has very low hardware requirements.
