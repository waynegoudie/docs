> An all encompassing home media server and docker server

## What it is

First things first, when i was originally thinking about how I could build the ultimate home media server, I did what all people do when they have no idea. I googled it! This lead me to this artcile [Docker Home Media Server](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/docker-home-media-server-2018-basic/) which is what 90% of my build is today. I'm in no way trying to steal or pretend that I came up with this idea, I'm merely rewriting in my own words for my own configuration as I have started to exapnd beyond this build. A good example is this documentation page, which is utlising [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) published via github pages.

I also got scared that one day [Docker Home Media Server](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/docker-home-media-server-2018-basic/) may no longer exist and I would have no idea how to rebuild my server!

To start using it, all you need to do is create an `index.html` and [deploy it on GitHub Pages](deploy.md).

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.
