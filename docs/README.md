> An all encompassing home media server and docker server

## What it is

First things first, when i was originally thinking about how I could build the ultimate home media server, I did what all people do when they have no idea. I googled it! This lead me to this artcile [Docker Home Media Server](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/docker-home-media-server-2018-basic/) which is what 90% of my build is today. I'm in no way trying to steal or pretend that I came up with this idea, I'm merely rewriting in my own words (or sometimes in smarthomebiginners words) for my own configuration as I have started to exapnd beyond this build. A good example is this documentation page, which is utlising [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) published via github pages.

I also got scared that one day [Docker Home Media Server](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/docker-home-media-server-2018-basic/) may no longer exist and I would have no idea how to rebuild my server!

Now, What is it?

### WHAT IS A HOME MEDIA SERVER?
A Home Media Server is a server located in your home network that acts as a central data storage and serving device. Typically, a home server is always on, has tons of storage capacity and ready to serve files (including media) when the need arises. If you do not yet have a home server or are considering building one, then read this summary on the [most common NAS or Home Server uses](https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/nas-home-server-uses/). If you are sold, then read on. 

To start using it, all you need to do is create an `index.html` and [deploy it on GitHub Pages](deploy.md).

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.

### OBJECTIVES OF THIS DOCKER HOME MEDIA SERVER
One of the big tasks of a completely automated Media server is a media aggregation. For example, when a TV show episode becomes available, automatically download it, collect its poster, fanart, subtitle, etc., put them all in a folder of your choice (eg. inside your TV Shows folder), update your media library (eg. on Plex) and then send a notification to you (eg. Email, Mobile notification, etc.) saying your episode is ready to watch. Sounds awesome right? There are several apps that can do such tasks which are included in this setup.

## Features

- Automated TV Show download and organization
- Automated Movie download and organization
- On-demand or automated torrent download
- On-demand or automated NZB (Usenet) download
- Serve and Stream Media to Devices in the house and outside through internet
- On demand torrent and NZB search interface
- Act as a personal cloud server with secure file access anywhere
- Provide a unified interface to access all the apps
- Update all the apps automatically
